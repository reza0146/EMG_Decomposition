%{
This function starts running the EMG decomposition algorithm proposed by
Negro et al. (2016)
Link to the paper: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/13/2/026027/meta

Arguments
    REQUIRED
    x: A cell array containing the raw EMG data. Each cell represents a channel and needs to contain
    a row vector.

    r: Extenstion factor as explained in the paper

    OPTIONAL
    discard: Discards the specified channel. Use it to remove channles that
    are corrupted.

    bandpass (default = true): If true applies a dual pass butterworth bandpass filter to the raw
    data.
    
    fs (default = 2048): Sampling frequency of the EMG signals.
    
    low_cut (default = 10): The lower cutoff frequency of the bandpass
    filter mentioned above.
    
    high_cut (default = 900): The higher cutoff frequency of the bandpass
    filter mentioned above.

    filt_order (default = 6): The order of the dual pass bandpass filter.
    This number will be divided by two to be used by the filtfilt function.

    center (default = true): Centers all the EMG channels around zero by
    subtracting the mean.

    M (default = 64): Number of iterations of the whole algorithm. 
    
    l_peaks (default = 31): Half of the length of action potentials (L as
    in paper) in samples. 
    If l_peaks = 31 --> The action potentials will have a length of 63
    samples.

    tolx (default = 10e-4): The threshold for defining convergance in the
    seperation loop (first loop).
    
    max_iter_sep (default = 10): The maximum allowed number of iterations
    before convergence happens in the separation loop (first loop). Passing
    this number means not converging. 
    
    verbose (default = false): If true, additional information is printed
    in the command window during the run of the algorithm.

    cont_fun (default = "skew"): Determines which contrast function to be
    used in the separation loop.
    See the documentation of the apply_contrast function for all the available contrast 
    functions to be used.

    max_iter_ref (default = 20): The maximum allowed number of iterations
    before convergence happens in the refinement loop (second loop). Passing
    this number means not converging. 

    check_pnr and pnr_th (default = true & 30): If check_pnr = true, the algorithm checks the 
    pulse-to-noise (pnr) score of the identified source and only accepts it if
    the pnr score is higher than the threshold (pnr_th).
    Check this for more information about the PNR measure: 
    https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/11/1/016008

    check_pnr and pnr_th (default = true & 30 dB): If check_pnr = true, the algorithm checks the 
    pulse-to-noise (pnr) score of the identified source and only accepts it if
    the pnr score is higher than the threshold (pnr_th).
    
    check_sil and sil_th (default = true & 0.9): If check_sil = true, the algorithm checks the 
    silhouette score (sil) of the identified source after the second loop and only accepts it if
    the sil score is higher than the threshold (sil_th).
    
Outputs
    results: A strcuture containing the results of the decomposition
    algorithm. The fields of this structure array are as follows:
    
        x_flat_dis_fil_cr: The raw EMG signals after the going through
        pre-processing. Each row contains a channel. The pre-processing
        steps include: flatten --> discrad --> filter --> center

        z: The x_flat_dis_fil_cr after being extended by a factor of r and
        being whitenned. 
        
        B: The final separation vectors (omegas in the paper). Each column represents a separation 
        vector (omegas).
        
        MUPulses: A cell array containing the firing indices of the
        identified sources. Each cell corresponds to a source. Each cell
        contains a row vector with the firing indices of the identified
        source.

        sil_all: A row vector containing the silhouette scores for all of
        the identified sources. 

        pnr_all: A row vector containing the pulse-to-noise scores for all
        of the identified sources.
