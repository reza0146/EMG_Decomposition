# EMG_Decomposition
This MATLAB package can be used for decomposing multi-channel electromyography signals into their comprising individual motor unit signals. 
The package implements a blind source separation alogorithm based on the paper published by [Negro et al. (2016)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/13/2/026027/meta).
