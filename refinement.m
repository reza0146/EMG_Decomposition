function  [w_out, s_out, a_indices_out, sil_score, pnr_score , saved_cv] = ...
refinement(w_in, z, options)
%{
This function implements the refinement loop (second loop, Steps 4 and 5 in the pseudo code 
in the paper).
This loop includes estimating the activation pulse train with peak detection
and K-means++ classification and then improving the estimated source by an
attempt to minimize the variability of discharge (measure: coefficient of variation of inter-spike
intervals).


Inputs
    REQUIRED
    w_in: The separation vector (1D column vector) identified by the first loop (separation
    loop). This separation vector will be refined here. 

    z: The whitened extended observations (2D array). Rows represent
    channels and their extended versions. Columns are samples.
    
    OPTIONAL
    max_iter_ref (default = 20): The maximum allowed number of iterations
    before convergence happens in the refinement loop (second loop). Passing
    this number means not converging. 
    
    l_peaks (default = 31): The minimum one-sided distance between identifed peaks. 
    The motor unit spike train is estimated by a peak detection algorithm applied 
    to the squared of the source vector and then K-means classification (two classes) of the
    identified peaks.

    k_plot (default = false): If true, creates a figure showing the results
    of the K_means algorithm.
    The motor unit spike train is estimated by a peak detection algorithm applied 
    to the squared of the source vector and then K-means classification (two classes) of the
    identified peaks.
    In the proposed study (Negro 2016), in most cases, the   source vector contained the 
    contribution of relatively high peaks (A) and relatively small peaks
    (B).The class with the highest centroid was selected for the estimation of the discharge times.

    save_cv (default = false): If true the coefficient of variation (cv) of the 
    inter-spike intervals (isi) for all iterations will be saved in a row vector (saved_cv).
    Each element in the array corresponds to one iteration.
    
    verbose (default = false): If true additional information will be
    displayed in the command window. 

Outputs
    w_out: The refined separation vector (1D column vector). If the refinement loop does not
    converge, this variable will be equal to an empty array.

    s_out: The accepted source after the refinment process (1D row vector). If the refinement loop 
    does not converge, this variable will be equal to an empty array.
    
    a_indices_out: The spike train indices associated with the accepted
    source at the end of the refinement loop (1D vector). These are the
    high peaks after the peak detection and Kmeans are applied.
    If the refinement loop does not converge, this variable will be equal to an empty array.
    
    sil_score: The silhouette score (sil) related to the accepted source. The SIL was defined as 
    the difference between the within-cluster sums of point-to-centroid distances 
    and the same measure calculated between clusters. The measure was normalized dividing by the 
    maximum of the two values.
    
    pnr_score: The pulse to noise ration (pnr) related to the accepted source.

    motor unit discharge patterns from high-density surface EMG

    saved_cv: An array containing the coefficient of variation of the
    inte-spike intervals for each iteration (1D vector).
